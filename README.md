# Trajectory_optimization_10DoF_skeleton

The Final Project for the Simulation of Movement course consists of choosing
one model of our interest and using the knowledge achieved during the
course and laboratories and simulate the movement from a starting position
and final position using Dynamic Optimization Methods using Direct Collocation
(DC) using CasADI[1][3] as a library inside MatLab.

This model has in the end 10 degrees of freedom as described however
it only has 7 joint moments regarding from the 4th to the 10th coordinates.
So it is a under torqued model in which the Optimization Solver is going to
take a little a little more to compute the optimal solution.

In conclusion the simulation of movement project has been a success. The
main objective of the project was to get comfortable with MATLAB and
the CasADI framework and also with the model selected to perform the dynamic
optimization problem. For instance I think that this project helped
us a lot to internalise the methods learnt during the course especially the
formulation of the kinematics and the dynamic optimization method using
direct collocation (DC).

Also, The three-step cost functions (L1,L2,L3) successfully transformed
the initial erratic motion into a dynamic, human-resembling walk. Furthermore,
the project demonstrated the efficiency of digital models in approximating
forces, particularly the reaction forces between feet and floor. This
not only validated the muscle-generated movement but also showcased the
potential for cost-effective simulations to replace traditional, expensive force
plate measurements. In essence, this project not only provides insights into
optimizing movement dynamics but also highlights the true potential of digital
simulations, making them valuable tools for cost-efficient bio-mechanical
analyses and enhancing our understanding of human-like motion.
